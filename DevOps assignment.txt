DevOps Student Assignment Instructions
Objective
Design and deploy a fully automated serverless application on AWS using Infrastructure as Code (IaC). The application should list S3 objects, send an email notification on each execution, and upload local files to the S3 bucket during deployment. The Lambda must also be manually triggerable for testing purposes.

Requirements
1. GitHub Repository Setup
Create a public GitHub repository
Include a well-structured README.md explaining:
Project overview
Setup and deployment steps
Manual Lambda test instructions
Tools/frameworks used (e.g., AWS CDK, Terraform)

2. Infrastructure as Code
Use code to define and deploy all AWS resources
Accepted tools:
AWS CDK (preferred)
Terraform
CloudFormation
Serverless Framework

3. Lambda Function
Language: Python or Node.js
Function must:
List all objects in a specified S3 bucket
Publish a message to an SNS topic with execution details

4. S3 Bucket
Create the S3 bucket using IaC
Upload files from a local folder (e.g., sample_files/) to the bucket as part of the deployment process
Can be implemented using SDK calls, CLI commands, or CI pipeline steps

5. IAM Role
Define an IAM role with least-privilege permissions:
S3 read access
SNS publish access
Lambda execution
Attach the role to the Lambda function using code

6. SNS Topic and Email Subscription
Create an SNS topic via code
Add an email subscription to receive notifications when the Lambda is invoked
Note in the README that the recipient must confirm the email after the first deployment

7. CI/CD with GitHub Actions
Automate deployment with a GitHub Actions workflow:
Trigger on workflow_dispatch (manual trigger)
Deploy all infrastructure

8. Manual Lambda Trigger Test
Add a way to manually trigger the Lambda function, for example:
A test script using the AWS CLI (e.g., aws lambda invoke)
A script using the AWS SDK (e.g., boto3 or aws-sdk)
A test event file (JSON) used with the CLI or console
Document the manual trigger process clearly in the README.md

Deliverables
GitHub repository containing:
Infrastructure code (IaC)
Lambda function code
sample_files/ folder with sample S3 data
GitHub Actions workflow
Test script or method for manual Lambda invocation
README.md with complete instructions
AWS deployment must include:
Lambda function that lists S3 objects and sends SNS email alerts
Confirmed SNS email subscription
Files uploaded to S3 from local folder during deployment
Verified manual trigger of Lambda function
